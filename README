This is a simple application derived from a default application created by Ramaze. This application also includes a rakefile that shows how to run sequel migrations that will work both locally with sqlite and with Heroku and PostgreSQL. 

The idea is to get this application up and running on Heroku and then put up a blog post on SteamCode on how to accomplish the task.
